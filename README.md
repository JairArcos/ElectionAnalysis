**Resources**
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.7, Visual Studio Code, 1.38.1 & GitBash.

**Learnings**

A pseudocode was written to guide us through Python code constrution, pseudocode is an informal language that has no syntax ules and is not meant to be executed, nonetheless it's very helpful to have track code and have a higher visibility in scripts functionality. 

Dependencies were included, they are modeles and packages, or programming scripts that allows you to increase the functional programming of your code, or speed and efficiency.

Lists & dictionaries were included to define names and count votes from election results database. 

Calculations were performed to calculate election winner, largest county voter turnout and some other statistics about votes - percentage per candidate. Results were printed in summary to be presented to the Colorado Board of Elections. Results were saved in GitHub.
